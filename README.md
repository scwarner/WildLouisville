# WildLouisville
This is a website about hiking in the Louisville, Ky., area. It was my capstone project for Coursera's Spring 2017 Web Design for Everybody specialization.

Students had three choices for their capstone:
1.  Build a site from scratch
2.  Build a site using a framework
3.  Build a site using a template

Since I had never built a site using a framework, I chose that option. I took all the photos (I fully acknowledge I am *not* a professional photog!) and wrote the content. The photos are not yet web optimized, so the site takes a while to download.

The site is hosted on Amazon Web Services with the domain name of  [WildLouisville.com](http://wildlouisville.com).
